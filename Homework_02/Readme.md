# Homework 2:

Add a Homework_02 directory to your local repository commit all the changes and sync it to GitHub to turn in this homework.

1. Create a Jupyter notebook with nice formatted markdown incorporating at least one table and one figure (video optional, but awesome). You can start from the webpage you created for last week's homework.
2. The notebook should also contain an SVG drawing of a house and happy people just like a kindergarten student would draw. Like this (this is just to practice drawing SVG, you can use Visual Studio to draw the figure, and you can draw whatever you want, this is just an example):

3. **CHALLENGE (optional):** Modify the graphing program from the SVG class ([02_svg.ipynb](./02_svg.ipynb)) to make a line plot with points. In other words, start with the program from the class and make it add lines between the points .
